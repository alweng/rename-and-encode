renamefrom and encodefrom
-------------------------

These programs rename and encode variables in Stata using external crosswalks. Crosswalks can be stored as Excel workbooks (.xls or .xlsx), character-delimited files (such as .csv), and Stata datasets (.dta). 

### Installation ###
Open Stata and install the programs from the SSC repository by running the commands
```
ssc install encodefrom
```

After installing the files, you can read the documentation by running `help renamefrom` and `help encodefrom` in Stata.

For a similar package in R, see Benjamin Skinner's crosswalkr:
