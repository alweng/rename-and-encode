renamefrom and encodefrom: Rename and encode variables using an external spreadsheet
--------------------------------

binscatter is a Stata program which generates binned scatterplots.  These are a convenient way of observing the relationship between two variables, or visualizing OLS regressions.  They are especially useful when working with large datasets.

renamefrom is a Stata program which renames and labels variables using values specified in an external spreadsheet. Also using an external spreadsheet, encodefrom encodes a variable with values and value labels. 

### Installation ###
Open Stata and install renamefrom and encodefrom from the SSC repository by running the commands
	ssc install renamefrom
and
	ssc install encodefrom

After installing the files, you can read the documentation by running 
	help renamefrom
and
	help encodefrom
